# AM-FordFulkerson

Ford-Fulkerson algorithm
The Ford–Fulkerson method or Ford–Fulkerson algorithm is a greedy algorithm that computes the maximum flow in a flow network. It is sometimes called a "method" instead of an "algorithm" as the approach to finding augmenting paths in a residual graph is not fully specified or it is specified in several implementations with different running times.
